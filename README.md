# Classifiying patients with liver diseases

### Business Problem: 
There is a severe shortage of doctors in rural areas with the ratio of doctor to patients being less than 1:1000. Often the already exhausted doctors also have to do basic diagnosis and follow up with treatment procedures.

### Goal:
The goal of the project was to classify the patients as 'liver_patient' or 'healthy'  based on the data obtatined from medical reports. Data was cleaned before spliting into training and testing data. The classification techniques used were KNN, Logistic Regression and CART. CART was found to be the most effective technique with and accuracy of 81% with only 400 data points
